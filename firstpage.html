                <p class="main-text">
                    Panic attacks can cause your breathing to speed up, which can ultimately feed into your fears. By slowing your breathing down, you can reduce other symptoms, helping to bring the attack to a halt. Deep breathing is a great option as long as you can focus on breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth — slowly and methodically.                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Start with this strategy, called the 4-7-8 breath, developed by Dr. Andrew Weil Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound.                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    •	Close your mouth and inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of four. </p>
                    <p class="main-text">  •	Hold your breath for a count of seven. </p>
                    <p class="main-text"> •	Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound to a count of eight. </p>
                    <p class="main-text">  •	This is one breath. Now inhale again and repeat the cycle three more times for a total of four breaths.</p>

                <p class="main-text">
                    Start counting backward from 100 by 3s. The act of counting at random intervals helps you to focus and override the anxious thoughts that are trying to sneak into your psyche. Better still keep loose change in your pocket. Add a dime to a nickel, then add two pennies, and so on. By controlling your thoughts and focusing on something outside yourself you will being to feel calmer.                </p>

                <p class="main-text">
                    Some panic attacks come from triggers that overwhelm you. If you’re in a fast-paced environment with a lot of stimuli, this can feed your panic attack.                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    To reduce the stimuli, close your eyes during your panic attack. This can block out any extra stimuli and make it easier to focus on your breathing.                </p>

                <p class="main-text">
                    Sights and sounds can often intensify a panic attack. If possible, try to find a more peaceful spot. This could mean leaving a busy room or moving to lean against a nearby wall.                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Sitting in a quiet place will create some mental space, and it will make it easier to focus on breathing and other coping strategies.                </p>

                <p class="main-text">
                    Grounding yourself is another helpful technique. Tune yourself into 4 things around you that you can see, 3 things you can touch, 2 that you smell and 1 you can taste. Again, forcing your mind to consider something outside yourself helps.                </p>

                <p class="main-text">
                    If panic attacks frequently occur in the same environment, such as a workplace or social space, it may be helpful to inform somebody and to let them know what kind of support they can offer if it happens again.                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    If an attack happens in public, telling another person can help. They may be able to locate a quiet spot and prevent others from crowding in.                </p>

                    Above everything else, be really nice to yourself after a panic attack. Those things are mighty draining, and scary, and uncomfortable, so the least you can do is treat yourself well afterward. Take a bath, curl up with some snacks, watch your favorite movie — anything that will make you feel comfy and relaxed.                </p>

                <p class="main-text">
                    A panic attack is a profoundly draining experience, so it's especially important not to neglect those basic needs such as, you know, eating. You might be craving something with sugar — and you should feel free to go for it — but we'd suggest opting for something more satisfying and nutrient-rich to help regain your energy. Try one of these snacks that are guaranteed not to mess with your ability to fall asleep.                </p>

                    If you feel exhausted, we don't blame you. And you should definitely listen to your body here. If you're somewhere you can take a nap, go for it. But also be mindful of your ability to get a full night's sleep later on. To that end, try to cap your nap at 30 minutes and save the rest for bedtime.                </p>

Maintaining social contact (not necessarily talking just about your anxiety) can also help prevent future panic attacks.                </p>

                    After a panic attack, your personal thoughts and energy can zone in on your anxiety and symptoms. So lying around and mulling it over isn't always the best idea. Instead, you'll want to focus your attention elsewhere, like on a relaxing task or hobby. Occupying your mind will ward off negative thoughts, and help keep the panicky feelings at bay.                </p>

                    If your mind is racing, then purposefully slow things down with a bit of meditation. A simple five minutes to focus on your breath should do the trick, especially if you're still feeling so out of control.                </p>

                    Day-to-day life can bring stresses large and small. Taking them in stride begins with taking care of yourself.                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    •	Eat right. Try for a balanced diet. Stay away from foods that don’t agree with you, because the reactions can cause anxiety.                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    •	Avoid smoking and caffeine. They can ratchet up anxiety.

                <p class="main-text">
                    •	Don’t drink alcohol or use illegal drugs. They may seem to calm you down. But they can throw off your emotional balance, interfere with your sleep, and conflict with medications.

                    The most effective form of professional treatment for tackling panic attacks, panic disorder, and agoraphobia is therapy. Even a short course of treatment can help.                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    •	Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on the thinking patterns and behaviors that are sustaining or triggering your panic attacks and helps you look at your fears in a more realistic light. For example, if you had a panic attack while driving, what is the worst thing that would really happen? While you might have to pull over to the side of the road, you are not likely to crash your car or have a heart attack. Once you learn that nothing truly disastrous is going to happen, the experience of panic becomes less terrifying.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    •	Exposure therapy for panic disorder allows you to experience the physical sensations of panic in a safe and controlled environment, giving you the opportunity to learn healthier ways of coping. You may be asked to hyperventilate, shake your head from side to side, or hold your breath. These different exercises cause sensations similar to the symptoms of panic. With each exposure, you become less afraid of these internal bodily sensations and feel a greater sense of control over your panic.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Mindfulness and meditation are other practices that can help deal with negative thoughts.With practice, we can recognize what we’re doing and replace those thoughts with positive ones. We can see the good in what happens and let go of things we can’t control.

                    Taking care of yourself physically can improve your state of mind. Think about trying some of these:
                <p class="main-text">
                    •	Regular exercise. It’s a proven stress-buster and it helps your mood, sleep, and just about everything else. To get the most benefit, aim for at least 2.5 hours a week of moderately intense activity, such as walking, or 1.25 hours of harder exercise, such as jogging or swimming laps.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    •	Yoga, tai chi, and other slow-paced activities. They can simmer down anxiety.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    •	Breathing exercises. When you learn to control how fast you inhale and exhale, then practice it every day, that can ease anxiety. You can also draw on it to help calm you if you do have an attack.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    •	Enough sleep. It keeps you from being groggy during the daytime.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    A number of medications are helpful for preventing panic attacks. Consider talking with you doctor about whether this would be appropriate for you.

                <p class="main-text">
                    •	Manage your time. Make to-do lists and give yourself enough time for each job. If you have a big project, break it down into manageable pieces and set mini-deadlines for them.

                <p class="main-text">
